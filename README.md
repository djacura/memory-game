# Memory Game

This is a memory game, I have created using HTML, CSS and Javascript. the website is intended for users to be able to play a memory game where they flip cards over and try to find matching pairs, once the first card is flipped over the timer starts, they then have until the timer runs out to finish the game or they have to start over again.

## Comments

When I first started this project I wanted to creat a colour matching memory game like simon says but I couldn't get my head round the coding or design of it so I changed the whole game and tried something different and went with a memory card game instead.

## UX 

I wanted to create this website to have a place where people could come and play this game and have a bit of fun, I also wanted to create this game because I am a gamer myself and wanted something that I found fun to play and could share that with other people and showcase my love for games.

This is a wireframe mock up that I designed for this project. [Download Wireframe Here](https://github.com/djacura/memory-game/raw/master/assets/wireframe/memory%20game%20wireframe.pdf)

user stories of this website include:

* As a player, I want to play a memory game, so I can improve my memory.
* As a player, I want a challenge, so I want different difficulty settings.
* As a Player, I want to see instructions, so I Know how to play the game. 

## Features

* A main Menu with instructions on how to play the game.
* buttons for links to different difficulty settings.
* different pages for each difficulty setting.
* modals for whether you win or you lose. 

## Features Left to Implement

* One feature I would like to add would be the ability to add a leaderboard to the website so that you can see who has the highest scores.
* with the leaderboard feature I would like to add the ability to login to the website and then this would be able to track users and their scores.

## Technologies Used

Here is list of the Technologies that I used to Implement the site:

* HTML/CSS
* Bootstrap 4
* Font Awesome and Google Fonts
* Javascript and Jquery

## Testing

This is a List of the testing that was carried out on the Website and all testing was conducted manually.

I created the website mainly on my PC using Chrome browser.

* Checked that the webpage worked on different browsers I used chrome, Firefox and edge. 
* Checked that I could not click too many cards at once.
* Checked that all the links on the page and modals all worked as needed.

I also had 10 people test the game for me and could not find anything abnormal with the game. the only thing that was wrong was the music for the modals could not be played on IOS mobile or safari browsers. as I didn't have access to safari or an IOS device I could not test this during development.

Here is a link to screenshots of the code being checked on Validation websites. [Links Here](https://github.com/djacura/memory-game/tree/master/assets/testing) 

## Deployment

The site is deployed on GitHub pages, directly from the master branch. All further commits will be on the master branch. A cloned site can be deployed on GitHub via the following steps:

* Go to the setting menu on the GitHub repository
* Scroll down to find the 'GitHub Pages' subtitle and change the source to 'master branch'
* A link will appear beneath the 'GitHub Pages' subtitle with your hosted site.

The site can be cloned to a local repository by using the following link (GitHub guide link [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)):

## Credits

I used most of the code from bootstrap for the HTML part of the website, and for the Javascript I received inspiration for this project from freecodecamp.net and their version of a memory card game and some code was taken from there for my project.
